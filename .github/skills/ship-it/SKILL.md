# Ship It — Prek, Commit, Push & Monitor Deploy

End-to-end workflow: run prek checks, run tests, fix failures, commit, push, and monitor the GitHub Actions deploy pipeline through to a healthy production readiness check.

**This skill orchestrates the full ship cycle. Do NOT skip steps.**

---

## When to Use

- User says "ship it", "land this", "commit and deploy", "push and deploy"
- User wants to commit, push, and ensure a successful deploy
- After completing a feature or fix and wanting to ship to production

---

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- `git` configured with push access to the remote
- `prek` installed (`brew install j178/tap/prek`)
- Working directory is inside the repository

---

## Step 0: Match User's Energy

Reply with "LFG 🚀 I'll ship it" to acknowledge the user's intent.

---

## Step 1: Run Prek

```bash
cd <workspace> && uv run prek run --all-files
```

### Handling Failures

Prek hooks may auto-fix issues (ruff lint `--fix`, ruff format, trailing whitespace, end-of-file).

**If prek fails:**

1. **Check if hooks auto-fixed files** — many hooks modify files in place. Re-run prek:
   ```bash
   uv run prek run --all-files
   ```

2. **If the second run passes** — the auto-fixes resolved everything. Proceed to Step 2.

3. **If the second run still fails** — manual intervention needed:
   - **Ruff lint errors**: Read error output, fix the code, re-run
   - **ty type errors**: Read error output, fix type issues, re-run
   - **check-yaml / check-json**: Fix malformed YAML/JSON files
   - **check-added-large-files**: Remove or `.gitignore` the large file
   - **check-merge-conflict**: Resolve merge conflict markers

4. **Keep re-running prek** until all hooks pass.

**Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until prek passes cleanly.**

---

## Step 2: Run Tests

Run the full test suite locally. This catches runtime errors (template rendering, import issues, dependency upgrades) that static checks cannot detect.

```bash
cd <workspace>/api && uv run pytest tests/ -x --tb=short
```

### Handling Failures

**If tests fail:**

1. Read the failure output — fix the code
2. Re-run prek (Step 1) if you changed Python files
3. Re-run tests until all pass

**Do NOT proceed to commit until all tests pass. No exceptions.**

---

## Step 3: Stage Changed Files

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

**Always stage ALL changes. Never cherry-pick files. `ship it` means ship everything.**

```bash
git add -A
git diff --cached --stat
```

---

## Step 4: Commit

**If the user provided a commit message**, use it directly.

**If no commit message was provided**, generate one based on the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<type>: <concise description>"
```

Conventional commit types: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `test:`, `chore:`

Ask the user for a commit message if the intent is ambiguous.

---

## Step 5: Push

```bash
git push
```

If rejected (behind remote):
```bash
git pull --rebase && git push
```

**Note**: The deploy workflow triggers on pushes to `main`. If on a different branch, inform the user that deployment won't trigger automatically.

---

## Step 6: Monitor the Deploy Workflow

After pushing to `main`, the `deploy.yml` workflow triggers automatically.

### Wait for Workflow to Appear

```bash
sleep 5
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 1
```

### Watch the Workflow

```bash
gh run watch --exit-status
```

This blocks until the workflow completes. Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure.

**If the workflow succeeds** — report success and the deploy URL. Done!

---

## Step 7: Diagnose Deploy Failures

If the workflow fails:

```bash
run_id=$(gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
gh run view $run_id --log-failed
```

### Common Failure Patterns

#### CI Failures (lint-and-test job)

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `ruff` lint errors | `cd api && uv run ruff check --fix .`, commit & push |
| `ruff-format` | `cd api && uv run ruff format .`, commit & push |
| `ty` type errors | Fix type errors, commit & push |
| `pytest` / `FAILED` | `cd api && uv run pytest tests/ -x`, fix, commit & push |

#### Terraform Failures

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `Error acquiring the state lock` | Extract Lock ID, `cd infra && terraform force-unlock -force <lock-id>`, re-run |
| `AuthorizationFailed` | Check `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret — not fixable locally |
| `ResourceNotFound` | `terraform refresh` or re-import |

#### Build/Deploy Failures

| Pattern | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `docker build` fails | Fix Dockerfile or `pyproject.toml`, commit & push |
| Smoke test `curl -f` fails | Check `docker logs`, fix startup issue, commit & push |
| API readiness timeout | Check app logs: `az containerapp logs show ...` |

### Fix and Re-deploy

After fixing:
1. Run prek again (Step 1)
2. `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: resolve deploy failure"`
3. `git push`
4. Monitor again (Step 5)

If no code changes needed (e.g., state lock):
```bash
gh run rerun $run_id
gh run watch --exit-status
```

---

## Step 8: Verify Production

After a successful deploy:

```bash
curl -s https://<api-url>/health
curl -s https://<api-url>/ready
```

## Full Ship-It Flow Summary

```markdown
## Ship It: <branch-name>

### 1. Pre-commit
✅ All hooks passed / ❌ Failed → fixed → ✅ Passed on re-run

### 2. Stage
✅ X files staged

### 3. Commit
✅ `<commit-hash>` — `<commit-message>`

### 4. Push
✅ Pushed to `<branch>` on `origin`

### 5. Deploy Workflow
✅ Run #<id> — succeeded in X min / ❌ Failed (see step 6)

### 6. Deploy Fix (if needed)
❌ <failure reason> → fixed → ✅ Re-deployed successfully

### 7. Production Health
✅ /health — healthy | /ready — ready
```

---

## Retry Policy

- **Pre-commit auto-fixes**: Re-run up to 3 times
- **Deploy failures**: Attempt fix + re-deploy up to 2 times
- **If still failing**: Stop and report the issue with full error context

## Trigger Phrases

- "ship it"
- "commit and deploy"
- "push and deploy"
- "land this"
- "deploy this"

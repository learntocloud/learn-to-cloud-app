# Ship It — Pre-commit, Commit, Push & Monitor Deploy

End-to-end workflow: run pre-commit checks, fix failures, commit, push, and monitor the GitHub Actions deploy pipeline through to a healthy production readiness check.

**This skill orchestrates the full ship cycle. Do NOT skip steps.**

---

## When to Use

- User says "ship it", "land this", "commit and deploy", "push and deploy"
- User wants to commit, push, and ensure a successful deploy
- After completing a feature or fix and wanting to ship to production

---

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- `git` configured with push access to the remote
- `uv` available for running pre-commit
- Working directory is inside the repository

---

## Platform Detection

**CRITICAL**: Detect the OS first and use appropriate commands:

- **Windows**: Use PowerShell commands
- **macOS/Linux**: Use bash commands

---

## Step 1: Run Pre-commit

Run pre-commit on all files to catch lint, format, and type errors before committing.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
Set-Location <workspace>\api; uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
cd <workspace>/api && uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Handling Failures

Pre-commit hooks may auto-fix issues (ruff lint `--fix`, ruff format, trailing whitespace, end-of-file).

**If pre-commit fails:**

1. **Check if hooks auto-fixed files** — many hooks (ruff, trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer) modify files in place. Re-run pre-commit to confirm fixes are clean:
   ```powershell
   # Windows
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

2. **If the second run passes** — the auto-fixes resolved everything. Proceed to Step 2.

3. **If the second run still fails** — there are issues that require manual intervention:
   - **Ruff lint errors**: Read the error output, fix the code, re-run.
   - **ty type errors**: Read the error output, fix type issues, re-run.
   - **check-yaml / check-json**: Fix malformed YAML/JSON files.
   - **check-added-large-files**: Remove or `.gitignore` the large file.
   - **check-merge-conflict**: Resolve merge conflict markers.

4. **Keep re-running pre-commit** until all hooks pass with no failures.

**Do NOT proceed to commit until pre-commit passes cleanly.**

---

## Step 2: Stage Changed Files

After pre-commit passes (including any auto-fixed files), stage the changes.

### Check What Changed
```powershell
# Windows
git status
git diff --stat
```
```bash
# macOS/Linux
git status
git diff --stat
```

### Stage Files

Stage all changed files (including any auto-fixed files from pre-commit):

```powershell
# Windows / macOS / Linux
git add -A
```

**Review what's staged** to ensure nothing unexpected is included:
```powershell
git diff --cached --stat
```

---

## Step 3: Commit

Commit with a clear, conventional-commit-style message.

**If the user provided a commit message**, use it directly.

**If no commit message was provided**, generate one based on the changes:

```powershell
git commit -m "<type>: <concise description>"
```

Conventional commit types:
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `refactor:` — code restructuring
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `style:` — formatting, no logic change
- `test:` — adding or fixing tests
- `chore:` — maintenance, dependencies

Ask the user for a commit message if the intent is ambiguous.

---

## Step 4: Push

Push to the current branch:

```powershell
git push
```

If the push is rejected (e.g., behind remote), pull first:
```powershell
git pull --rebase && git push
```

**Note the branch name** — the deploy workflow triggers on pushes to `main`. If on a different branch, inform the user that deployment won't trigger automatically and they may need to open a PR.

---

## Step 5: Monitor the Deploy Workflow

After pushing to `main`, the `deploy.yml` workflow triggers automatically.

### Wait for Workflow to Appear

The workflow may take a few seconds to start. Poll until it appears:

```powershell
# Windows / macOS / Linux
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5  # or: sleep 5
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 1
```

### Watch the Workflow

Use `gh run watch` to monitor in real-time:

```powershell
gh run watch --exit-status
```

This blocks until the workflow completes and exits with:
- **Exit code 0**: Workflow succeeded
- **Non-zero exit code**: Workflow failed

**If the workflow succeeds** — report success and the deploy URL. Done!

---

## Step 6: Diagnose Deploy Failures

If the workflow fails, diagnose the issue.

### Get the Failed Run ID

```powershell
$runId = (gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
```

```bash
run_id=$(gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
```

### View Failed Logs

```powershell
gh run view $runId --log-failed
```

### Common Failure Patterns and Fixes

#### CI Failures (lint-and-test job)

| Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `ruff` lint errors | Lint failures in CI | Run `cd api && uv run ruff check --fix .`, commit & push |
| `ruff-format` | Format differences | Run `cd api && uv run ruff format .`, commit & push |
| `ty` type errors | Type checking failures | Fix type errors, commit & push |
| `pytest` / `FAILED` | Test failures | Run `cd api && uv run pytest tests/ -x`, fix failing tests, commit & push |

#### Terraform Failures

| Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Error acquiring the state lock` | State locked by a prior run | Extract Lock ID, run `cd infra && terraform force-unlock -force <lock-id>`, then re-run |
| `AuthorizationFailed` | Expired credentials | Check `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret — not fixable locally |
| `ResourceNotFound` | Resource deleted outside TF | Run `terraform refresh` or re-import |

#### Build/Deploy Failures

| Pattern | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `docker build` fails | Dockerfile or dependency issue | Fix Dockerfile or `pyproject.toml`, commit & push |
| Smoke test `curl -f` fails | API doesn't start in container | Check `docker logs`, fix startup issue, commit & push |
| `Trivy` vulnerabilities | Security scan found HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs | Warning only (non-blocking), note in report |
| Container app update fails | Azure deployment error | Check Azure resource status, may need re-run |
| API readiness timeout | App didn't become ready in 5 min | Check app logs: `az containerapp logs show ...` |

### Fix and Re-deploy

After fixing the issue:

1. **Run pre-commit again** (go back to Step 1)
2. **Commit the fix**: `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: resolve deploy failure"`
3. **Push**: `git push`
4. **Monitor again** (go back to Step 5)

If the fix doesn't require code changes (e.g., Terraform state lock), re-run the workflow:

```powershell
gh run rerun $runId
gh run watch --exit-status
```

---

## Step 7: Verify Production

After a successful deploy, verify the production API is healthy:

```powershell
# Get the API URL from the workflow output
gh run view $runId --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | select(.name | contains("deploy")) | .steps[] | select(.name | contains("Wait for API")) | .name'
```

Or check the known production URL if available:

```powershell
# Windows
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://<api-url>/health" -UseBasicParsing).Content
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://<api-url>/ready" -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -s https://<api-url>/health
curl -s https://<api-url>/ready
```

## Full Ship-It Flow Summary

Report progress using this format:

```markdown
## Ship It: <branch-name>

### 1. Pre-commit
✅ All hooks passed / ❌ Failed → fixed → ✅ Passed on re-run

### 2. Stage
✅ X files staged

### 3. Commit
✅ `<commit-hash>` — `<commit-message>`

### 4. Push
✅ Pushed to `<branch>` on `origin`

### 5. Deploy Workflow
✅ Run #<id> — succeeded in X min / ❌ Failed (see step 6)

### 6. Deploy Fix (if needed)
❌ <failure reason> → fixed → ✅ Re-deployed successfully

### 7. Production Health
✅ /health — healthy | /ready — ready
```

---

## Retry Policy

- **Pre-commit auto-fixes**: Re-run up to 3 times (auto-fixes cascade)
- **Deploy failures**: Attempt fix + re-deploy up to 2 times
- **If still failing after retries**: Stop and report the issue to the user with full error context

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "ship it"
- "commit and deploy"
- "push and deploy"
- "land this"
- "commit push and monitor"
- "deploy this"

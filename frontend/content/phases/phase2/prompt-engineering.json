Don't assume the model knows context.\n\u2022 Provide Context - Background info improves response accuracy significantly.\n\u2022 Use Few-Shot Examples - Showing examples of desired input/output pairs is one of the most powerful techniques.\n\u2022 Request Specific Format - Specify exactly how you want the output (JSON, markdown, bullets, etc.).\n\u2022 Adjust Temperature - Use 0 for consistent/deterministic outputs, higher (0.7-1.0) for creative tasks."

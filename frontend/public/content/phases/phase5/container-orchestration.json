  "description": "As applications grow in complexity, managing containers manually becomes challenging. Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It's widely used in modern cloud-native environments to ensure applications are highly available, scalable, and resilient.",

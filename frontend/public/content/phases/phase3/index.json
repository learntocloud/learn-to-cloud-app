  "description": "You've now written code from scratch, debugged your own errors, and built a working API. That struggle was intentional\u2014it built mental models you can't get any other way. Now you're ready to use AI tools effectively. The difference between a beginner who uses Copilot and an experienced dev who uses Copilot is massive: the experienced dev knows when Copilot is wrong, when to reject suggestions, and how to guide it. This phase teaches you to use AI as a learning accelerator, not a crutch.",
  "short_description": "Learn to use AI tools effectively: GitHub Copilot, prompt engineering, and AI-assisted learning. Improve your Phase 2 capstone with better prompts.",
  "additional_context": "This phase is about developing discipline with AI tools. You'll use them to deepen your understanding\u2014not to skip learning. The goal is to become a developer who can leverage AI while maintaining critical thinking and code ownership.",

If you find yourself accepting suggestions without understanding them, stop and reconsider. AI should help you learn faster, not skip learning entirely.",

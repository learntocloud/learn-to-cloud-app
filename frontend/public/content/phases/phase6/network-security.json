Your Journal API's database shouldn't be accessible from the public internet, and your API should only accept traffic the way you intend. Let's set up the network boundaries that make that possible.",

Understanding the difference trips up a lot of people, so let's be clear:\n\n**Security Groups (Stateful):**\n- Like a firewall around a single resource (your API server, your database)\n- Allow rules only—everything is blocked by default\n- Stateful means if you allow traffic in, the response is automatically allowed out\n\n**Network ACLs (Stateless):**\n- Like a firewall around an entire subnet\n- Has both allow AND deny rules\n- Stateless means you have to explicitly allow both inbound AND outbound traffic\n\nFor your Journal API: a security group on your API server allows port 443 (HTTPS) from anywhere. A security group on your database allows port 5432 (PostgreSQL) only from your API server's security group."

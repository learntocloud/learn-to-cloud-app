The difference between a minor incident and a catastrophe is how prepared you are to respond. In this topic, you'll learn how to detect threats automatically and how to respond when something does go sideways.",

This is where your monitoring from the previous topic pays off\n3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** — Stop the bleeding, remove the threat, and get back to normal\n4. **Post-Incident Activity** — The most underrated step. What went wrong? How do we prevent it next time?\n\nFor your Journal API, think about: what would you do if your database credentials got leaked on GitHub?"

Could be a misconfigured database or a leaked connection string.\n- **Resource Hijacking** — An attacker uses your cloud account to mine cryptocurrency. You get the bill.\n- **Misconfigurations** — You accidentally make your database publicly accessible. More common than you'd think.\n- **Supply Chain Attacks** — A compromised pip package or npm module in your dependencies."

Security monitoring is how you keep an eye on everything—it's your early warning system. Think of it like this: locks on the doors are great, but you also need security cameras. In this topic, we'll set up the cameras for your Journal API.",

Here's how to build alerts that actually help:\n\n- **High signal-to-noise**: Only alert on things that actually need attention\n- **Actionable**: Every alert should tell you what to do about it\n- **Escalation**: Different severity levels—a failed login doesn't need the same urgency as \"all data is being exported\"\n- **Context**: Include enough info to start investigating without having to dig through three dashboards"

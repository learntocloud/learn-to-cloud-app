        ("Is it free?", "Yes! Learn to Cloud is completely free and open source."),
        ("Do I need prior experience?", "No prior cloud experience is needed. Phase 0 covers prerequisites like Linux, networking, and programming fundamentals."),
        ("How long does it take?", "It depends on your pace and background. Most learners complete all phases in 3-6 months of part-time study."),
        ("How do I get my certificate?", "Complete all phases including the hands-on verification tasks. Once everything is verified, you can generate a certificate from your dashboard."),
        ("Can I skip phases?", "You can read any phase, but hands-on verification builds on earlier phases. We recommend following the sequence."),
        ("How does hands-on verification work?", "Each phase has practical tasks — creating a GitHub profile, deploying an API, analyzing code. You submit proof (URLs, tokens, or code) and our platform verifies it automatically."),

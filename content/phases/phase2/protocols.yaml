  title: View Active Connections
  description: Use ss -lntup as your primary command to see listening ports and owning processes. If you're on Windows, run these commands inside WSL. Use netstat only as a fallback on older systems. You may need sudo to see process names/PIDs for services owned by other users.
  code: '# Primary (modern)

    ss -lntup

    sudo ss -lntup


    # Optional (process-oriented view)

    lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

    sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN


    # Fallback (older systems)

    netstat -tulpn

    sudo netstat -tulpn'

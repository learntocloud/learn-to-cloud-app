name: Securing Your Cloud Applications
description: You've built your Journal API, deployed it to the cloud, and set up CI/CD pipelines. Now it's time to lock it
  down. Security isn't a separate thing you bolt on at the end—it's something every cloud engineer needs to think about from
  day one. In this phase, we'll walk you through the key security practices that keep real production apps safe. By the end,
  your Journal API will be hardened and production-ready.

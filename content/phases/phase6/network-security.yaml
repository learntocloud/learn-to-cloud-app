  text: Understand security groups vs network ACLs
  action: 'Learn:'
  description: Security groups are stateful firewalls around individual resources (allow rules only). Network ACLs are stateless
    firewalls around entire subnets (allow AND deny rules). For your Journal API, a security group on the database should
    allow port 5432 only from your API server.

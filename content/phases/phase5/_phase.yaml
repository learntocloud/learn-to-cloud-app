  summary: Finished the DevOps capstone? Submit your repo URL and the system will verify your work automatically.
  includes:
  - Complete the DevOps Capstone Project
  - Submit your journal-starter fork URL for automated verification
  requirements:
  - id: devops-implementation
    submission_type: devops_analysis
    name: Completed DevOps Capstone
    description: Submit your journal-starter fork after completing the DevOps Capstone Project for automated verification.
    submission_instructions: Paste the URL to your journal-starter fork (e.g. https://github.com/your-username/journal-starter).
      The system will fetch and analyze your code to verify the capstone requirements. It reads the actual file contents
      (not just filenames), so placeholder or empty files will not pass. You'll get per-task feedback explaining what
      passed and what needs work.
    placeholder: https://github.com/username/journal-starter
    example_url: https://github.com/your-username/journal-starter
    note: You can only verify once per hour.
prerequisites:
- 'Completed Phase 3: Programming Fundamentals (capstone)'
- 'Completed Phase 4: Cloud Platform Fundamentals (capstone)'
- This phase builds on the project from previous phases

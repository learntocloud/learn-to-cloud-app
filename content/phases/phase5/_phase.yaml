    description: Add a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow, Terraform configuration in infra/, and Kubernetes manifests
      in k8s/ to your journal-starter fork.
    submission_instructions: Paste the URL to your journal-starter fork (e.g. https://github.com/your-username/journal-starter).
      The system will scan your repo for a Dockerfile, a CI/CD workflow in .github/workflows/, Terraform files in an infra/
      directory, and Kubernetes manifests in a k8s/ directory.

name: Monitoring & Observability
description: Monitoring and observability are essential DevOps practices that help you understand the health, performance, and reliability of your applications and infrastructure. In this topic, you'll learn how to set up monitoring using Prometheus and visualize metrics with Grafana. You'll then explore AI agents with n8n to automate incident response.

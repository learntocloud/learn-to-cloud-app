name: 'Capstone: DevOps Project'
description: Now that you've learned the fundamentals of DevOps, it's time to apply these practices to the Journal API app you built in Phase 3 and deployed in Phase 4. In this capstone, you'll containerize the app, automate its deployment, manage infrastructure as code, set up monitoring, and orchestrate containers with Kubernetes—demonstrating your end-to-end DevOps skills.
short_description: Containerize your app with Docker, deploy to Kubernetes, automate with CI/CD, and monitor with Prometheus/Grafana.

  title: Clean up your cloud resources
  description: After you have submitted your repo for hands-on verification and received a passing result, delete all cloud resources — Kubernetes clusters, container registries, Terraform-provisioned infrastructure, and any other resources. Run `terraform destroy` for IaC-managed resources. Check your cloud console to confirm nothing is still running.

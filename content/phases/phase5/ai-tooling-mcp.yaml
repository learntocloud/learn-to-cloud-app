description: Modern DevOps workflows increasingly integrate AI-powered tools. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standard way for AI assistants to interact with external services through containerized servers. In this topic, you'll learn what MCP is, set up MCP servers in VS Code, and use GitHub Copilot to query your CI/CD pipelines and cloud telemetry.

  title: Create a Capstone Preflight Check Skill
  description: Create an Agent Skill at `.github/skills/preflight-check/SKILL.md` that validates your capstone project is submission-ready. The skill should instruct Copilot to run bash commands that check for required files, verify the Docker build, run terraform validate, and confirm Kubernetes manifests are valid YAML. Then trigger it by asking Copilot to run the preflight check and fix any issues it finds.

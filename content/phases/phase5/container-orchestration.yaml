name: Container Orchestration - Kubernetes
description: As applications grow in complexity, managing containers manually becomes challenging. Kubernetes (K8s) is an
  open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  It's widely used in modern cloud-native environments to ensure applications are highly available, scalable, and resilient.

hands_on_verification:
  summary: Finished the Cloud Deployment capstone? Submit your live API URL and the system will verify it automatically.
  includes:
  - 'Complete the Capstone: Cloud Deployment'
  - Submit your deployed API's HTTPS URL for automated verification
  requirements:
  - id: deployed-journal-api
    submission_type: deployed_api
    name: Deployed a Public Journal API
    description: Submit your deployed Journal API's HTTPS URL. The system will verify you own the API by creating a test
      entry, confirming it appears, and deleting it. Your POST, GET, and DELETE /entries endpoints must all be working.
    submission_instructions: "Paste your deployed API's base URL (e.g. https://my-journal-api.azurewebsites.net).
      Before submitting, make sure: 1) The URL uses HTTPS. 2) Your API's POST /entries, GET /entries, and
      DELETE /entries/{id} endpoints are all working. 3) You have at least one journal entry already created.
      The system will post a temporary challenge entry to your API, check that it appears in GET /entries,
      then delete it. This proves you control the API — not just that some URL returns JSON."

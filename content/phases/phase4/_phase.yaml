    submission_instructions: "Paste your deployed API's base URL here (e.g. https://my-journal-api.azurewebsites.net).
      Before submitting: 1) Make sure the URL uses HTTPS (HTTP will be rejected). 2) Create at least one journal
      entry via POST /entries so the database is not empty. The system will call GET /entries on your URL and verify it returns
      a JSON array with at least one valid entry containing id, work, struggle, intention, and created_at fields."

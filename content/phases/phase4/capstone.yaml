description: Deploy your Journal API from the Phase 2 Capstone to a secure 2-tier cloud architecture. This capstone challenges
  you to research, design, and implement a production-ready environment with proper networking and security.
short_description: Deploy your Journal API to a secure 2-tier cloud architecture with VMs, networking, and managed database.

- order: 1
  text: Design your 2-tier architecture
  action: 'Design:'
  description: Plan your cloud infrastructure on paper or a diagram. You need a public tier for your FastAPI application server
    and a private tier for your PostgreSQL database. Decide how you'll separate them with networking.
- order: 2
  text: Set up your VPC with public and private subnets
  action: 'Hands-on:'
  description: Create a VPC or VNet with at least two subnets — one public (for the API) and one private (for the database).
    Configure routing and security groups.
- order: 3
  text: Deploy the API server in the public subnet
  action: 'Hands-on:'
  description: Deploy a VM in the public subnet, install your Journal API, and configure it to be accessible from the internet.
- order: 4
  text: Deploy the database in the private subnet
  action: 'Hands-on:'
  description: Deploy PostgreSQL in the private subnet. Ensure it is NOT directly accessible from the internet and only accepts
    connections from your API server.
- order: 5
  text: Connect the API to the database and test
  action: 'Hands-on:'
  description: Configure your API server to connect to the database in the private subnet. Verify all CRUD operations and
    the AI analysis endpoint work correctly.
- order: 6
  text: Verify your deployment meets success criteria
  action: 'Verify:'
  title: Success Criteria
  description: 'Confirm your deployment meets these requirements: API accessible from the internet, database only accessible
    from the API server, all CRUD operations work, AI analysis endpoint returns sentiment and summary, LLM API key stored
    securely, and data persists between restarts.'
- order: 7
  text: Share your project
  action: 'Share:'
  title: Share Your Progress
  description: When you've completed the capstone, push your work to GitHub and write a brief technical writeup covering
    your architecture, security decisions, and key learnings. Share it on LinkedIn or the Learn to Cloud community Discord
    to get feedback and celebrate your progress.

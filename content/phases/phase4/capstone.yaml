description: Deploy the Journal API you built in Phase 3 to a secure 2-tier cloud architecture. This capstone challenges you to research, design, and implement a production-ready environment with proper networking and security, using the database and deployment preparation work you completed in earlier Phase 4 topics.

  description: Use your Topic 5 database planning and Topic 6 deployment runbook as inputs. Then plan your cloud infrastructure on paper or a diagram. You need a public tier for your FastAPI application server and a private tier for your PostgreSQL database. Decide how you'll separate them with networking.

  title: Success Criteria
  description: 'Confirm your deployment meets these production goals: API accessible from the internet over HTTPS, database only accessible from the API server, CRUD operations behave correctly, AI analysis endpoint returns sentiment and summary, LLM/API secrets are stored securely, data persists between restarts, and telemetry is configured so you can see API requests/errors and application logs in your cloud monitoring service. Note: these are broader engineering goals; automated hands-on verification focuses specifically on HTTPS + POST/GET challenge-response for /entries.'

  title: Clean up your cloud resources
  description: Once your capstone has been verified, delete all cloud resources — VMs, VPC/VNet, subnets, security groups, databases, and any other infrastructure you provisioned. Check your cloud console to confirm nothing is still running. You will redeploy in later phases using containers and infrastructure as code.

  title: Share Your Progress
  description: When you've completed the capstone, push your work to GitHub and write a brief technical writeup covering your architecture, security decisions, and key learnings. Share it on LinkedIn or with the Learn to Cloud community to get feedback and celebrate your progress.

description: Deploy the Journal API you built in Phase 3 to a secure 2-tier cloud architecture. This capstone challenges you to research, design, and implement a production-ready environment with proper networking and security, using the database and deployment preparation work you completed in earlier Phase 4 topics.

  description: Use your Topic 5 database planning and Topic 6 deployment runbook as inputs. Then plan your cloud infrastructure on paper or a diagram. You need a public tier for your FastAPI application server and a private tier for your PostgreSQL database. Decide how you'll separate them with networking.

  title: Success Criteria
  description: 'Confirm your deployment meets these production goals: API accessible from the internet over HTTPS, database only accessible from the API server, CRUD operations behave correctly, AI analysis endpoint returns sentiment and summary, LLM/API secrets are stored securely, data persists between restarts, and telemetry is configured so you can see API requests/errors and application logs in your cloud monitoring service. Note: these are broader engineering goals; automated hands-on verification focuses specifically on HTTPS + POST/GET challenge-response for /entries.'

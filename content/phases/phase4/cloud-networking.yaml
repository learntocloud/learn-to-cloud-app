name: Cloud Networking Fundamentals
description: In the previous topic you worked on deploying a VM in the cloud, using default configurations like the VPC, Security Groups etc. This topic focuses on deepening your understanding of cloud networking concepts essential for secure deployments. It builds on Phase 2 networking fundamentals and applies them to provider-specific architecture and validation workflows.

description: Welcome to Phase 3! This phase is all about programming with Python and building real applications. Programming
  is a fundamental skill for cloud engineering, enabling you to create, manage, and optimize cloud resources efficiently.
  You'll build a working API with database integration—the foundation for everything that follows.
short_description: Learn Python programming, REST APIs, FastAPI, and databases. Build a real-world Journal API project.

  icon: 🐍
additional_context: You don't need to know how to build UIs but you need to know how to work with APIs and databases. Focus
  on understanding the code you write—avoid using AI assistants for code completion in this phase. You'll learn to use those
  tools effectively in Phase 4.
order: 3
prerequisites:
- 'Completed Phase 1: Linux and Bash'
- 'Completed Phase 1: Linux CTFs'
capstone:
  title: 'Capstone: Learning Journal API'
  summary: Build a working FastAPI + PostgreSQL API and integrate an LLM for entry analysis. This project becomes the foundation
    for later phases.
  includes:
  - Fork the starter repo and implement the Journal API
  - Persist entries in a database
  - Integrate an LLM provider for analysis
  - Write clear README documentation
  topic_slug: build-the-app
hands_on_verification:
  summary: Prove your Journal API works locally and that you can use basic API workflows.
  includes:
  - Fork the journal-starter repository
  - Create at least one entry via POST /entries
  - Paste a valid JSON response from GET /entries
  requirements:
  - id: journal-starter-fork
    submission_type: repo_fork
    name: Forked the Journal Starter Repo
    description: Fork the journal-starter repository and set up the FastAPI + PostgreSQL project for local development.
    submission_instructions: Paste the URL to your fork of the journal-starter repo (e.g. https://github.com/your-username/journal-starter).
      The system will verify it is a fork of learntocloud/journal-starter under your GitHub account.
    placeholder: https://github.com/username/journal-starter
    example_url: https://github.com/madebygps/journal-starter
    required_repo: learntocloud/journal-starter
  - id: journal-api-implementation
    submission_type: code_analysis
    name: Implemented the Journal API
    description: Implement the Journal API with CRUD endpoints, database models, and LLM integration, then submit your fork for automated verification.
    submission_instructions: Paste the URL to your journal-starter fork (e.g. https://github.com/your-username/journal-starter).
      The system will analyze your code for correct CRUD endpoints, database models, and LLM integration.
    placeholder: https://github.com/username/journal-starter
    example_url: https://github.com/madebygps/journal-starter
    note: You can only verify once per hour.

warning: As learners finish this phase, many will share their code. We recommend you do not copy and paste anybody's solution.
  You are only doing a disservice to yourself and will not make it in this field if that is the mentality you have. Additionally,
  we recommend you turn off any AI assistants for code completion—you need to build muscle memory and understanding first.
  Using AI to ask for explanations is fine, but write your own code.

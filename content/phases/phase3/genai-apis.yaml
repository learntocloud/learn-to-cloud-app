  text: Understand the messages format
  action: 'Learn:'
  title: LLM Message Format
  description: 'LLMs work with conversation-style inputs: system messages (set behavior), user messages (your input), and
    assistant messages (LLM responses). Understanding this structure is key to working with any LLM API.'
- order: 2
  text: Understand completions and parameters
  action: 'Learn:'
  title: Completions & Parameters
  description: 'The API generates text (completions) based on your input. Key parameters to understand: temperature (0 = deterministic,
    1 = creative), max_tokens (response length), and model (which LLM version). You can also request structured outputs like
    JSON instead of free text.'

    "Today I learned about FastAPI and built my first endpoint.

    The automatic documentation is amazing! I struggled a bit with

    async functions but the official tutorial helped. Tomorrow I''ll

    tackle database integration."'

  description: Dr. K explains why self-help content crosses from helpful to harmful — why watching another roadmap or
    motivational video feels productive but actually replaces doing the work. Commit to this learning resource until you
    finish it and stop. Every time you watch a roadmap video, you are restarting your journey. Stop doing that.

    browser extension (or similar) to hide social media feeds. This removes the temptation to scroll YouTube, Twitter, or
    LinkedIn when you sit down to study. You can toggle it off when you need to, but the default should be distraction-free.

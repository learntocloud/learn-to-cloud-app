  title: What Does a Cloud Engineer Do?
  description: >
    A cloud engineer designs, builds, and maintains the infrastructure that runs applications in the cloud.
    Day-to-day, that can include provisioning servers and databases, writing infrastructure-as-code,
    setting up CI/CD pipelines, monitoring system health, managing costs, and responding to incidents.
    They work across teams — with developers to deploy code reliably, with security to lock down access,
    and with leadership to choose the right services for the job. The role blends system administration,
    networking, automation, and software development. No two days look the same, and the tooling evolves
    constantly, so curiosity and a willingness to learn are just as important as any specific technology.

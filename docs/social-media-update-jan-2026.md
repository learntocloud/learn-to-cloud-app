# Learn to Cloud Social Media Update - January 2026

## Full Version (LinkedIn / Blog)

When I started Learn to Cloud 5 years ago, I built a curriculum—what I wished existed when breaking into cloud engineering: no degree, no $10K bootcamp, just free resources and a clear path.

Since then, I've watched bootcamps charge thousands for what amounts to repackaged free content and false promises. They exploit the belief that people can't learn on their own. What really pissed me off is about two weeks ago, someone blatantly copied our entire curriculum and just posted it on their own domain and was posting about it. That's when I knew it's enough. It's time to leverage all these AI coding tools to build the next version of Learn to Cloud.

Tech is fundamentally about teaching yourself. The earlier you learn how to learn, the better your career. I have always been a firm believer that you should be a person of high agency, of discipline, and it is quite hard to develop that, but very possible if you have the right systems in place. So with that mentality in mind, I made sure to build a new version of Learn to Cloud, not just as a curriculum, but a system that forces you to build these things.

The new Learn to Cloud isn't just a curriculum—it's a **tool that proves you've learned.** Here's what makes it different:

**7 phases** covering IT fundamentals → Linux → Programming → **AI tools** → Cloud → DevOps → Security

**You cannot fake progress.** Every phase has hands-on verification:
- Phase 0: Verify your GitHub account and profile README
- Phase 1: Complete 18 Linux CTF challenges (cryptographic token verification)
- Phase 4: We **call your deployed API** and validate the response
- Phase 5: We check your GitHub Actions actually ran

**AI-graded knowledge checks** - Explain concepts in your own words. No multiple choice BS. We use AI to grade your explanations, ensuring you actually understand the material.

**Gamification that matters** - 7 phase badges, streak tracking with forgiveness (life happens), and verifiable certificates with unique codes.

**One continuous project** - What you start in Phase 0, you'll enhance through Phase 6 with everything you learn. The projects compound.

**Still free. Still open source.** Always will be.

Schools and bootcamps have used our curriculum (we see the analytics). That's open source—it is what it is. I just wish people understood you can get quality learning without spending thousands.

Launching in the coming weeks. The beauty of free: nobody tells us when to ship. We'll launch when it's ready.

## Short Version (Single Post)

5 years ago I built Learn to Cloud—free resources and a clear path into cloud engineering.

Two weeks ago someone copied our entire curriculum. That was enough.

New version: 7 phases, hands-on verification you can't fake, AI-graded explanations, one continuous project.

Still free. Still open source. Launching soon.
